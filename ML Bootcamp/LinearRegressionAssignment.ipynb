The MSE value is squared so as to make large errors even larger. One thing to pay close attention to, it that it is usually a hard metric to interpret due to the size of its values and of the fact that they aren't in the same scale of the data."

It is easier to interpret and good when we need to display or show the actual value of the data with the error. It shows how much the data may vary, so, if we have an RMSE of 4.35, our model can make an error either because it added 4.35 to the actual value, or needed 4.35 to get to the actual value.
